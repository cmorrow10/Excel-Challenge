# Excel-Challenge
## Requirements
#### Conditional Formating
##### - Conditional formatting is applied appropriately to the outcome column.
##### - Conditional formatting is applied appropriately to the percent funded column.
---
#### Column Creation
##### - Six new columns were correctly created for: percent funded, average donation, category, sub-category, date created conversion, and date ended conversion.
---
#### Pivot Tables and Stacked Column Charts
##### - Correctly created a pivot table that counts how many campaigns were "successful," "failed," "canceled," or are currently "live" per category.
##### - Correctly created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country.
---
#### Pivot Tables and Line Graphs
##### - Correctly created a pivot table with a column of outcome, rows of date created conversion, values based on the count of outcome, and filters based on parent category and years.
##### - Correctly created apivot chart line graph.
---
#### Crowdfunding Goal Analysis
##### - Computed calculations of percentages for projects that were successful, failed, or were canceled per goal range.
##### - Created a line chart showing the relationship between the goals amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation.
---
#### Statistical Analysis
##### - Computed calculations of the mean, median, min, max, variance, and stdev using Excel formulas.
##### - A brief and compelling justification of whether the mean or median better summarizes the data.

## Written Report
##### This analysis shows the varius results for crowdfunding projects. In the parent category, Theater had the most "successful", "failed", and "canceled" results. In the sub-category, Plays out weighed all results from the other categories. Combining every project in the dataset, there were more "successful" results overall shown in each visualization.
##### The limitations of the dataset is that there are alot of varius categories combined together and can be broken down into more categories. Pie charts would be a useful visualization for future results.

## Statistical Analysis
##### In the statistic table showing "successful" and "failed" backers counts, finding the mean over the median would be better to summarize the data. In this particular dataset it's easier to see the average (mean) results, rather than the value directly in the middle (median). The varability of "successful" results in the table would make more sense because there's 265 more counts to show statistically.
